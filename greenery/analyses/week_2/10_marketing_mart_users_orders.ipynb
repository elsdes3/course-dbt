    "Develop a model for the marketing team to perform the following\n",
    "         \n",
    "1. analyze user ordering behavior\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this model should be aggregated at the user order level so it can be used by the marketing team in any other downstream model that is also aggregated at the user order level. Only user ID, state and aggregated columns should be included in this model.\n",
